This is a largely pared-down verision of the codebase that was made and edited over the course of the project. Not all changed files are in this present repo. Anything that was created/edited for this project but is otherwise avaiable on the public repo at https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX.jl was included in the same filepath locations that they exist in, in the private repo where work was done. As this is a manual copy of the code and blame history is intentionally reset, all blame history for the edits in these files should be to RichardZhu123. All non-code files in Example_Systems are copied from GenX prior work and were not edited for this project. More specified blame history can be given as needed. 

This submission includes only the report for Saad Ayub at this time. A later commit/fork and submission on Canvas will be made for the submission of Richard Zhu's report.
